# Part 1: Choose your own IoT Adventure

These will be timed activities.  Please note the timer and be sure to use your time wisely.

## Part 1.1: Picking a Mission (7 minutes)

Your group will be both a "Customer" and a "Designer".  First you'll prepare for your Customer role.  Browse through the "Mission" cards and select the one that interests you. You may use either the specific example on the card or be creative and try to develop another example that fits the goal given on the card. Any discussions with  Designers should not reveal the specific example you have in mind.  Try to really think about the example and how it would fit into your life as a customer. Try to build an entire story around it.  Make sure you have a clear vision in mind.

***Q1.1 Briefly describe your Mission:***
A device that would detect overdoses based off of sensors to monitor heart rate, skin conductance for sweating response and increased brain activity. This could alert authorities or doctors and possibly save a life.

## Part 1.2: Finding a Designer/Customer (3 minutes)

Find another group to work with. The other group should be students who neither of you have worked with before and far enough away that they didn't overhear any of your discussion of your Mission. One group will be "Designers" while another is "Customers".  Then the groups will switch roles (so each will be a Designer while the other is a Customer).  Pick which group is "Designing" first.

## Part 1.3 Empathizing (13 minutes total)

(7 minutes) The Designer's first step in design thinking is empathizing with the person who the design is for.  The Designer should have a conversation with the Customer to get to know them and to ask about the Customer's needs and interests.  The goal is to try to identify the customer's need, *not a specific solution*.  The Designers who are going first should interview the customer and try to figure out the underlying need they'd like to satisfy.  

***Q1.2 Share some notes from your interview here and try to describe the "need" with a very brief description:***
* Determine if there is too much of some chemicals in the blood
* Check the user's blood pressure and heart rate
* Identify the symptoms of the overdose
  * Could lead to false alarms
* Could use hardware that users already have like a fitbit
* Phone app to track and store data to the cloud


(6 minutes) Reverse roles. The Customers are now Designers and vice versa.  Repeat the interview process. (Designers, complete the question above in that space)
Product: Fix bad handwriting with a mechanical solution

## Part 1.4: Proposing solutions (8 minutes)

Return to your original locations.  In this step all groups will act like Designers.  Another vital aspect of design thinking is open-minded brainstorming about potential solutions that will fulfill the Customer's needs.   Review your notes about the Customer's needs.  Use cards from the Things, Services, Human Actions, and Feedback decks to *design two (2) or more different solutions* to the Customer's needs.

***Q1.3 Briefly describe your solutions (use a list) and any strengths/weaknesses you see.***
1. A device that would attach to the user's arm to assist in writing
   * Accelerometer
   * Pen/pencil for writing
   * Storage for character sets in different languages
    * Also for saving data for device improvement in future
2. A small device capable of printing simulated handwriting on a piece of paper
  * Storage for character set data and user data
  * Mic for voice input to record spoken text
    * Speech recognition
  * Printhead to print text on a sheet of paper

## Part 1.5: Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers:  Present your solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  As a Designer you should be open to any initial reactions.  Customers: think carefully about your original "need" and try to give both pros and cons of the proposed solutions.

***Q1.4 Designers: Briefly summarize their feedback for each solution:***
1. Fine motor movements may be hard to pick up. Handwriting has multiple patterns, hard to form a definition
2. Not on the person, more of a roundabout way.

(4 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 1.6: Iteration (6 minutes)

Return to your original seats.

In this phase everyone is thinking like a Designer.  Design thinking also relies on iterative refinement of work to suite the Customer.  Are there ways it could be improved?  Discuss the feedback and refine/update your work if needed.

***Q1.5 Based on the feedback, how might you change your solution?***
1. Place the accelerometer on the fingers of the user to track the fine motor skills better. Build more models of handwriting into our design by monitoring and recording different sample users.
2. Make it easy to carry with the person.

## Part 1.7 Evaluation (5 minutes)

Switch back to being a Customer and thinking about the product you want and the need it should meet.  Pick three (3) Criteria cards that are most important to you and order them from most important to least important.

***Q1.6 List your three top Criteria:***
1. Sustainability - the product should be durable and easily reparable. Supplies for the device should be available.
2. User Friendly - there should be little set up time and the device should be intuitive.
3. Market Potential - will this device be able to sell and affect the lives of many people.

## Part 1.8: More Feedback (10 minutes total)

Meet with your corresponding group again. And, again, select which set will be Designers first.

(5 minutes) Designers: Present your revised, final solutions and get the Customers' feedback.  Customers: Evaluate the proposed solution based on the Criteria you selected.

***Q1.7 Briefly summarize your findings as a Designer.  Is the customer happy with your work?  How could it be further improved?***


***Q1.8 Briefly summarize your findings as a Customer.  Will the proposed solution meet your needs?  Was it substantially different than what you may have initially envisioned?***
The final ideas seemed to match what we had envisioned. The sensors used were a bit different, but the product met our criteria. Their Criteria was, in order:
Feasibility
Utility
User Friendliness

(5 minutes): Reverse roles.  Designers and Customers: Fill in your answers to the question above.

## Part 2: Summary

### Review

Part of the goal of today's studio was to provide you some "menus" for:
   - common ingredients in IoT systems,   
   - scenarios where IoT may be of value, and
   - some criteria that can be used to evaluate the value of IoT systems.

***Q2.1 Without reviewing the cards, provide three examples of each type of card along with a brief description (try your best).  Add your answers as a sub-list for each type here:***
- Criteria
- Things
- Services
- Feedback
- Human Actions
- Missions

### Contrast

***Q2.2 In Studio 0 you were supposed to evaluate three examples of IoT. In many cases the examples may not be able to be represented using the cards.  Provide some examples of cards that you think should be added to the deck, either based on the examples from Studio 0, or from this Studio, or based on your own interests.  Be sure to specify the suit (Mission, Thing, Services, Human Interactions, Feedback, and Criteria) as well as a brief description:***
Human interactions - user input such as scheduling
